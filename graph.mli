(* Type of a directed graph in which vertices have labels of type 'v
 * and edges have labels of type 'e. *)
type ('v, 'e) graph

(* A graph is a mutable structure. *)

(* Each vertex has a unique identifier (a name). *)

(* Information about vertices. *)

     * The list is empty if the back option is false (see new_graph). *)

 * @raise Failure if the id is unknown. *)

(**************  CONSTRUCTORS  **************)

(* Creates a new (empty) graph. *)
val new_graph: unit -> ('v, 'e) graph

(* Add a vertex to the graph.
 * If a vertex already exists with this identifier, its label is replaced by this one. *)
val add_vertex: ('v, 'e) graph -> 'v -> id -> unit

(* Add an edge given the ids of origin (id1) and destination (id2).
 * If an edge already exists between id1 and id2, its label is replaced by this one. *)

(**************  COMBINATORS, ITERATORS  **************)

(* Iterate on all vertices. *)
val v_iter: ('v, 'e) graph -> (('v, 'e) vertex_info -> unit) -> unit

(* map graph vmap emap: maps all vertex labels by vmap and all edges label by emap
 * Returns a new graph. Vertices keep the same identifiers.
 * Beware that emap is called twice on each edge (ingoing and outgoing). *)

val map: ('v1, 'e1) graph -> ('v1 -> 'v2) -> ('e1 -> 'e2) -> ('v2, 'e2) graph
